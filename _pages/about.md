Hello there!

I am *Gopal*, a passionately consummate procrastinator. I like wheels, words and wanderings. This site (whose idea has lingered with me, at least, for more than a year) represents my experiments with hosting and maintaining my own blog.

I have been sporadically blogging, starting with Blogger and moving onto Medium, for a few years (not many posts though, tch!). I intend to make this site the new home for my blogs and all other things that I'd like to share. They'll live here thriving or rest in peace.

Professionally, I am a Software Engineer (such a cliche, I know!) working in the field of Networking and Security. You can look me up on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gopalvkulkarni), for a summary of my professional career thus far.
