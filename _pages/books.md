I'll use this page to catalogue the books I have read and my ratings for them.

My target for the year 2021 is to read 24 books. I'll keep updating the following table as and when I complete a book.

| Title | Author | Genre | My Rating | Remarks |
|------|--------|-------|-----------|---------|
| The Polymer Prince | Hamish McDonald | Non-Fiction | 4 | Fascinating tale of the rise of Reliance |
| The Great Indian Novel | Shashi Tharoor | Fiction | 4 | Mahabharata transformed into India's struggles before and after Independence |
| Life over Two Beers and other stories | Sanjeev Sanyal | Fiction | 4 | Intimate and intriguing details of Indian liberals' modus operandi |
| Eminent Historians: Their Technology, Their Line, Their Fraud | Arun Shourie | Non-Fiction | 5 | Must read for any thinking Indian |
