# Projects

This page contains the information about some of the projects that I get excited about or follow.

## Flute

My current project is to learn playing a flute (you thought of some techincal thingy? *gotcha!*). I am mostly learning this via some of the Youtube channels.

# Poem

You bring me joy
You make me smile
Out with you
I desire to travel many a mile

Glimpse of you bring me to deep thinking
And my dreary eyes they forget blinking

But when I am with you
The realisation is quite sudden
You are but a fruit forbidden!
