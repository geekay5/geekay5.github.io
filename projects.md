This page contains the information about some of the projects that I get excited about and then put them into that cavernous shelf of procrastination.

## Flute

My current project is to learn playing a flute (you thought of some techincal thingy? *gotcha!*). Diperate Youtube channels are my *gurus* in this endeavour

## Guitar

Learning to play a Guitar has been my *longest* project. I can play most of it now, only in my head! My fingers are still pretty shy in tugging those strings, you see.

Keep watching this space to get the latest and greatest about my exciting, new projects.
