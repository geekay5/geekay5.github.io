## Projects

This page contains the information about some of the projects that I get excited about or follow.

## Flute

My current project is to learn playing a flute (you thought of some techincal thingy? *gotcha!*). I am mostly learning this via some of the Youtube channels.

## Poem

You bring me joy<br>
You make me smile<br>
Out with you<br>
I desire to travel many a mile

Glimpse of you bring me to deep thinking<br>
And my dreary eyes they forget blinking

But when I am with you<br>
The realisation is quite sudden<br>
You are but a fruit forbidden!
