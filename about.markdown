Hello there!

I am Gopal and this site represents my experiments with hosting and maintaining my own blogs.

I have been sporadically blogging on blogger to begin with and then on medium for few years (not many posts though, tch). I intend to move all of it here.

So to that end the entire codebase for this website is located on [Github](https://github.com/kulgo/kulgo.github.io)

Professionally, I am a Software Engineer (such a cliche, you may say) working for an US based MNC in the field of networking and security.

You can look me up on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gopalvkulkarni)
