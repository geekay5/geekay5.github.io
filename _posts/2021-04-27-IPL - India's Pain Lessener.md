description: Is it okay for India to hold the IPL amidst a raging pandemic?

The so called second wave of the Covid-19 or the Chinese Virus pandemic in India has caused a humongous disaster across the country. Everyday the number of infected people are growing at an alarming scale. The number of people succumbing to this relentless and constantly mutating virus is increasing each passing day. The TV news channels, newspaper websites are filled with reports, with macabre visuals showing cremation pyres, of the devastation the unseen virus is raging across the length and breadth of the nation. The social media channels are lit with people from the supposedly Left and Right of the political divide using the same visuals to score a political point like vultures feeding on the dead.

Unlike other natural calamities like earthquake or floods or even Tsunami, a pandemic appears to be more devastating on the psyche of a nation. The biggest Earthquake will last a few seconds causing a great damage both to humans and their physical possessions. A flood will last a few days sweeping agony in its wake till it ebbs. These events would be mostly confined to specific, comparatively smaller epicenters. The fury of these disastrous doesn't prolong and within a couple of days their wreckage is complete. Of course it takes a whole lot longer for the rebuilding process. And soon the people (govt, admin, citizens) can start recovery process. In short the peak of the curve is more closer to the starting point and drops immediately then on.

This pandemic however has shown extreme perseverance. It's been more than year since it began and we still don't know if we are closer to the peak. The wreckage is across the globe. This makes the response that much more challenging since there will be cries for help from many places at the same time. The recent Oxygen crisis is a case in point. The duration of the pandemic takes a toll on the individual psyche at a different level. The stress of staying in a closed confinement, having to wear masks, being constantly vigilant while outside and the constant negativity all around can have a severe emotional impact. Lastly, the financial burden on the government and the public inflicted by the Virus are well documented.

Amidst all this the Board of Control for Cricket in India is conducting the Indian Premier League - often referred as the cricket jamboree. It has often raised debates and almost always remains in news for one reason or the other. The Cricket purists (yours truly believe himself to be one) don't find it to be real cricketing contest. Sure it's good entertainment but doesn't invoke an emotional attachment. Many others, who generally revel in making a luxurious living by putting India's poverty on show for their western consumers, find it a luxury that India can do without. After all, the players earn crores for a couple of months' work and that's just grotesque in a poor country like India, they reason. Of course, the matter that cricket players, both former and current, from much richer countries make a beeline to work(play and comment) in India doesn't exactly sit with the image that the western media is used to.

So, IPL has been a constant target whenever there's something miserable happening in the country. There's an election, stop the IPL. There's a draught, stop the IPL. And so it goes. So, it doesn't come as a surprise there's constant debate in the media (legacy and social) that should IPL-2021 be conducted in the midst and raging pandemic. I generally don't care too much if the IPL was cancelled, but this year I believe it is okay to hold the IPL. And, it is because we are in the midst of a gloomy pandemic. It is so because of the following reasons.

We all agree that the best strategy to control the spreading and the damage caused by the Virus is vaccination. The government is trying the same and it needs to scale it up immensely. Currently the vaccines production is not way below the demand. The companies have often said they need financial resources to increase production and have asked the government for the same. Basically the government needs to pay the vaccine companies and then get the vaccine and provide them for free or a subsidized prices to a big portion of the population. IPL can support this effort in it own little way.

All IPL teams together pay their player salaries amounting to ₹680 crores. At 30 percent income tax rates the TDS for these salaries comes to be ₹204 Crores
