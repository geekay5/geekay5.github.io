I"˜<p>Hello there!</p>

<p>I am Gopal and this site represents my experiments with hosting and maintaining my own blogs.</p>

<p>I have been sporadically blogging on blogger to begin with and then on medium for few years (not many posts though, tch). I intend to move all of it here.</p>

<p>So to that end the entire codebase for this website is located on <a href="https://github.com/kulgo/kulgo.github.io">Github</a></p>

<p>Professionally, I am a Software Engineer (such a cliche, you may say) working for an US based MNC in the field of networking and security.</p>

<p>You can look me up on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/gopalvkulkarni">Linkedin</a></p>
