Hello there!

I am *Gopal*, and, I belive, I am a passionately consummate procrastinator. This site (whose idea has lingered with me, at least, for more than a year) represents my experiments with hosting and maintaining my own blog.

I have been sporadically blogging, initially on Blogger and later on Medium, for few years (not many posts though, tch!). I intend to make this site the new home for my blogs, where they'll live thriving or rest in peace.

Professionally, I am a Software Engineer (such a cliche, I know!) working in the field of networking and security. I may add a page related to my work later on. For now, you can look me up on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gopalvkulkarni), for a summary of my professional career thus far.
